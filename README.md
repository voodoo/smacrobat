- This is the static version of Macrobat
- Macrobat is used to track and share what you eat
- Provide a pic, the weight, macros and fiber and Macrobat will tell you the calories
- Send it to others to see what you have eaten
- They can modify your entries, and send it back to you, if they think your macros or fiber are incorrect
- Macrobat assumes you have weighed what you have eaten
  - We do this because it is the one way to not guess - and gives you the best chance of getting macros/calories correct
